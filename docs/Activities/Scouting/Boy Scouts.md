# Boy Scouts
I started my journey in scouting as a Cub Scout and eventually earned Eagle Scout. Scouting gave me the chance to explore the outdoors, learn practical skills, and develop leadership abilities. Participated in Philmont and Northern Tier high adventure camps, gaining experience in backpacking, navigation, and teamwork.  Attended campouts regularly and other scouting events, building resilience, problem-solving, and outdoor skills.  

### Skills Learned
Scouting taught me many valuable skills through merit badges and hands-on experiences. These ranged from essential life skills like first aid, lifesaving, emergency preparedness, and communication, to unique abilities that are harder to find elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and rock climbing.

### Leadership Experience
Served as Patrol Leader, leading a group of scouts and ensuring patrol operations ran smoothly. Planned meals, organized tasks, and taught other scouts about various aspects of scouting.  Signed off on rank requirements and addressed conflicts within the patrol, developing leadership, organization, and mentorship skills.
