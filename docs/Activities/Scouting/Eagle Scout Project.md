# My Project
To achieve the rank of **Eagle Scout**, a **large-scale project** must be completed. I decided to help a **church** with **property maintenance**. Project had **four stages** and took **over 280 man hours**. Completed over the course of **5 months**. 


## 4 Parts, Each Significant
### 1) Improve 215 Yard Nature Trail

At the church, there is a community nature trail used by the church, scouts, and locals to enjoy the outdoors. Trail was neglected, needed to be relined, and cleaned up.

### 2) Fix 2 Foot Bridges

Along the trail, there are two foot bridges that allow passing over the varying terrain. Both needed cleansing of many seasons worth of mold, dirt, and leaves. One needed the entire railing replaced due to a critical split.	

### 3) Clear 1 Acre of Woods

The church owns an acre of woods that contains the nature trail which needed a general cleanup. Cleared dozens of dead, full-sized standing trees, down branches, weeds, and other debris.	

### 4) Remove 0.06 Acres *of Death*

Along the street to the parking lot there was a small, extremely packed strip of weeds, vines, and thorns that had not been taken care of for years. Took 3 work days to clear.

# The Impact
The church members, scouts, and even the community now has access to the nature trail and can enjoy a nice walk.
##### Safer
Makes the outdoor property significantly safer. With dead standing trees, dangerous weeds, and other tripping hazards gone, the church can use their outdoor chapel again and take advantage of the nature trail with confidence.

##### Give Back
The church allows our troop to have meetings in their building every week. It made sense to pick a project that benefited the church allowing us to keep our troop running.
##### Lively
Also makes the church more presentable and attractive for current and future members of the church.

# Hard Work Pays Off

Here are some before and after pictures:

*Insert Pictures Here*

Was the longest lasting project of my troop with over 5 months of planning and 2.5 months of actual project work. Planning delayed 12 weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Took over 280 total man hours, 10 separate work days and created 4 separate 25x20ft+ giant brush piles.



# Leadership

Led community, scouts, and others to accomplish something great. First priority was safety. I made sure everyone was following appropriate safety precautions, informed them of the hazards in the worksite, and reminded of breaks and water. I addressed questions and concerns of the helpers. Also kept the helpers motivated and focused, even when the work sucked. However all the effort was completely worth it!
