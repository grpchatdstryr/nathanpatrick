# Videography
Have edited multiple music videos for friends and for fun. Currently use DaVinci Resolve, but have used Premier Pro in the past. Mainly shoot video from my phone.

##### Music Video for a Friend.
All I did was the videography and scene planning. I had no influence on the lyrics and ideas, but had fun filming and editing the entire video. This was reviewed by YouTube Channel with over 3 Million Subscribers which their review video has over 300,000 views. This video is my friend's channel's most watched music video of all his music video content.

##### First Music Video
Edited a music video for the same friend. All I did was record and edit. I had no part in the song creation.

##### First Music Video Ever
I created this music video in High School because we had too much free time and thought it'd be fun. Even though the video is quite bad, it was fun to make a music video from scratch (excluding the beat).
