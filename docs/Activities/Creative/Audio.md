# Audio 

Since High School, have recorded and messed with a Mic for music and trumpet. Purchased a RØDE NT-USB Mini to record my trumpet auditions. In college, I took an audio production class using Adobe Audition. We did all sorts of projects. Also in college, I volunteered for Liberty's sports production (LBX). One of the roles was audio for D3-D1 Hockey.
