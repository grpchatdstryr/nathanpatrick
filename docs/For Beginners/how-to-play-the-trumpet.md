### Posture
Starting off with posture is important because posture goes into all the parts of practicing the trumpet. Making sure you have good posture means that your sound is maximized, you can have proper breathing, and more.

For proper posture, you want to sit up straight in your chair, shoulders even, with your trumpet just below, straight out. Your hand posture will want to go through the rings, with your pinky on top of the ring, not within, as it promotes better finger dexterity. Your feet should be flat on the floor with your legs slightly spread.

### Breathing
When you go to breathe, you’ll want to fully inhale, not from your chest but from your stomach. Having proper posture will ensure you are able to take deep breaths.

### Technique
You’ll want to make sure your embouchure when going to play is proper as described in the (How to Play). As well as follow proper mouthpiece pressure. Make sure your fingers are arched and fully in the middle of each valve. You don’t want any unevenness. This allows for better finger dexterity long-term.
