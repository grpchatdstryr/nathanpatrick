# Personal Projects
Part of how I learn and stay up to date is through personal projects. I prefer this learning method to reading text books, watch a professor yap through PowerPoint, etc... I also happen to really enjoy working on something that gives me a cool final outcome. So here is a list of various personal projects I have worked on. 

### Homelab (Version 1)

[GitHub](https://github.com/grpchatdstryr/Homelab-Documentation)

This was my first full homelab setup. I spent a lot of time planning the network, setting up servers, and automating tasks. It taught me a lot about how different systems work together and gave me a reliable environment to test new tools. I also documented everything so I could share what I learned.

### Homelab (Version 2)  
*Coming Soon*

The next version of my homelab is in the works. I’m planning to make it more automated setup. It will be a chance to take what I learned from version 1 and improve it with better tools and smarter configurations.

### Linux Project

This project is all about setting up and customizing Linux for my own setup. I worked on installing cool software, securing it, and making it easy to use. It’s a mix of practical setup and experimenting with new tools to see what works best.

### Meme Website

A small, goofy website I made for fun. Nothing serious, just a way to practice web development while creating something fun.

### Service Uptime Tracker

Uses a tool called Uptime Kuma and tracks the uptime of various services. Use discord as a SIEM when things happen using webhooks. 

### Capstone Individual Project

My capstone project was a personal project for the nonprofit company we were supporting, acting as a central documentation source. Simple website to host the information they may need. 

### This Website  
[Homepage Website](https://nathanpatrick.org)

Of course, this website itself is a project. Where I share my work, blog, and portfolio. It’s also a project that I’m frequently updating! 

### Technical Blogs  

Also have written about the projects I work on and what I learn along the way. Check the Blogs tab on [My Website](https://nathanpatrick.org)
