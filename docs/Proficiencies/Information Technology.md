# Information Technology

A collection of the tools, systems, and technologies I’ve worked with. Most of this comes from hands-on learning, personal projects, and real setups I’ve built, broken, and rebuilt. I like experimenting with different environments and documenting what I learn along the way. Can find some on my [my GitHub](https://github.com/grpchatdstryr).

### Homelab  
Built and managed my own homelab environment to practice networking, virtualization, and systems administration. This includes everything from hardware setup to configuring services and automations.

### New Homelab  
Currently redesigning and upgrading my homelab for better performance, scalability, and organization. Moving toward more efficient workflows, improved network layouts, and cleaner documentation.

### Linux (Most Distros)  
Experience working across multiple Linux distributions. I enjoy customizing systems, optimizing them for my workflow, and learning the differences between distros. Regularly use Linux for servers, VMs, and daily tasks.

### Docker  
Hands-on experience containerizing applications, managing images, and running lightweight services for testing and production use within my homelab.

### Ansible (a little bit)
Some experience writing simple playbooks and using Ansible for basic automation tasks. Still learning, but using it more as I expand my homelab.

### Servers
Worked with enterprise-grade server hardware, installing, configuring, and maintaining systems in a lab environment to understand real-world server workflows.

### Lab Tech  
Assisted with equipment setup, troubleshooting, imaging systems, and maintaining a clean and functional technical workspace.

### Hypervisors  
Worked with multiple hypervisors, mainly ESXi and Proxmox. Experience includes VM deployment, storage management, backups, clustering, and migrations.

### Windows, Linux, MacOS  
Comfortable working across all three major operating systems for both everyday use and technical tasks. Able to troubleshoot, configure, and use them in mixed-environment setups.

### Server Software
Configured and managed two servers running as a cluster using VMware ESXi and vCenter, hosting multiple virtual machines and services. I continuously learned, implemented, and documented new features throughout the process. Eventually migrated the entire setup to Proxmox for better flexibility and performance.
