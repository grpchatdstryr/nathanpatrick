# Cybersecurity
A mix of formal classes, self-directed training, and hands-on experience in cybersecurity, networking, and technical problem solving. Most of my learning has been through a combination of courses, teams, and personal practice.

### Formal Training
- 50+ Hours of Offensive Security Training through TCM Security (5 courses total). Focused on penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and ethical hacking.
- Security+ & Network+ certifications. Gained foundational knowledge in security, networking, and risk management.
- Completed multiple college and online courses covering cybersecurity (both business and technical), network security, system administration, and more.

### Cyber Team Experience
